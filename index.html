        Welcome to my webpage!

      </p>In this webpage, I am going to show you The Digital Health Canada Professional Career Matrix (2019), which clearly identifies career paths and
opportunities across nine unique domains and five proficiency levels within the digital
health sector. 
      </P>
       <h2>Titles listed in the Career Matrix represent a sample of possible roles available
within the domain; the education and skills outlined here are suggestions and do
not guarantee achievement of any particular role, job, or title. </h2>
